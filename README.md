  Stag Hunt Evolutionary Game Simulation in Complex Networks
</h1>

The Stag Hunt game is a classic scenario in game theory that demonstrates the conflict between safety and social cooperation. In this project, we simulate this game on a network of interconnected nodes, where each node represents an agent that can either cooperate (C) or defect (D). The simulation explores how cooperative behaviors evolve based on interactions with neighbors.
